    <h1>Which Power Ranger are you?
    </h1>
    <h2>Take this quick internal quiz</h2>
    <p>A quick way to figure out which Power Ranger you are is to treat it like a personality check instead of a real test. Think about how you act when you’re with friends: do you naturally lead, stay calm and plan, or bring the energy when everyone is tired? Then picture a stressful moment and be honest about your first reaction—rush in, think it through, or keep the group steady. Finally, pick the Ranger color you’re drawn to without overthinking it. Your choices usually match the role you play most often, and that’s basically your Ranger.

    <h2>How to know speciofically?</h2>
    <p>To know your Ranger, watch what you do when you are with other people. If you take charge and make decisions fast, you fit the Red Ranger vibe. If you think things through and solve problems, you lean Blue. If you bring energy and push people to keep going, you match Yellow. If you stay independent and intense, you match Green. If you keep the group together and support others, you match Pink.</p>
    <p>Also look at your first reaction in a stressful moment. Do you lead, plan, hype people up, or calm everyone down? Your most common reaction is usually your answer.
    <q>But don't overthink it.</q>
